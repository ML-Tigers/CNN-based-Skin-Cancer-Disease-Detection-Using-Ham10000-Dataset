# Skin-Decease-Detection-Using-Ham10000-Dataset

This popular dataset was an important assest in the field of medical science to pave the way for detectng skin deceases in the earlier stages. The aim in this project was to create a prediction model to identify the skin decease. 
Here total images used for training - 1400 
The accuracy was ~69%
The image size applied 64x64 instead of 32x32
Activation Function Used: Softmax
Optimizer : Adam
Further Improvements might br added in future.
